# CHANGELOG

## 2.8.1 - 2022-04-15

- Fix: Reset cached tip amount before collecting payment to fix an issue with on-reader tipping beta for WP3 readers. Note that WPE readers are not affected by this bug.
  This issue manifests if a payment is collected with tipping enabled and subsequently a payment is collected without tipping enabled
  while the POS app is still alive. The payment without tipping enabled would use the cached tip amount.
  See [issue 224](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-terminal-android/issues/224)

## 2.8.0 - 2022-03-28

- Beta: Incremental or extended authorization can be requested with `CardPresentParameters` and
  `PaymentMethodOptionsParameters` objects. See [extended auhorizations](https://stripe.com/docs/terminal/features/extended-authorizations#authorization-validity) and [incremental authorizations](https://stripe.com/docs/terminal/features/incremental-authorizations)

## 2.7.1 - 2022-03-21

- Fix: Resolved an issue causing the SDK to become unresponsive during payment collection.

## 2.7.0 - 2022-02-28

- New: `CollectConfiguration` object to provide an option to skip tipping when
  calling `Terminal.collectPaymentMethod`. It requires the use of a new `@OptIn`
  annotation; `@OnReaderTips`. See
  [Collect on-reader tips](https://stripe.com/docs/terminal/features/collecting-tips/on-reader)
  for details. Note that on-reader tips is in beta.
- New: Added `onBatteryLevelUpdate` callback in `ReaderListener` both for bluetooth and usb readers when connected.
  It reports battery info for every 10 minutes. See [issue 199](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-terminal-android/issues/199)
- New: The Example apps can now connect to internet readers. See [issue 174](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-terminal-android/issues/174) for details.
- Fix: Removed Android 12 Bluetooth permissions from the Android manifest. This
  fixes a Bluetooth-related permissions exception that was happening on Android
  12 devices when the application did not explicitly request the permisions.
- Fix: `ReaderListener.onReportLowBatteryWarning` can now be invoked during connect. See [issue 175](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-terminal-android/issues/175) for details.
- Beta: Usb connectivity available via `Terminal.connectUsbReader` for Chipper and WP3 readers. Note that this API isn't
finalized and may be changed. As a result, it requires use of a new `@OptIn` annotation;
`@UsbConnectivity`.

## 2.6.0 - 2022-01-24

- Fix: Resolved an issue where connecting to a WP3 immediately after an M2 can cause update failures.
- Fix: Stripe M2 Bluetooth pairing dialog is no longer displayed twice.
- Fix: Resolved NullPointerException thrown when `BluetoothDevice.name` isn't available during discovery. See [issue 196](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-terminal-android/issues/196) for details.
- Fix: Resolved an issue with Gson not being included as an explicit dependency. See [issue 188](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-terminal-android/issues/188) for details.
- Fix: Updated R8 keep rules to resolve an issue where Stripe M2 readers would fail to connect with minification enabled.
- Fix: Added Bluetooth scan rate limiting to avoid Android SDK silently failing when the scan rate limit is exceeded.
- Update: Added Bluetooth scan error handling and retries when scans fail due to `ScanCallback.SCAN_FAILED_OUT_OF_HARDWARE_RESOURCES` and `ScanCallback.SCAN_FAILED_SCANNING_TOO_FREQUENTLY`.
- Fix: Resolved an issue where errors thrown by the BBPOS SDK during Bluetooth reader updates can cause a deadlock and break future discovery attempts.

## 2.5.2 - 2021-11-22

- Fix: Calling `discoverReaders` with `DiscoveryMethod.BLUETOOTH_SCAN` returns local bluetooth readers regardless of whether or not the SDK has internet connectivity.
- Fix: Manual transaction cancellation during online processing now works as expected. See [issue 181](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-terminal-android/issues/181) for details.
- Fix: Pre-dipping immediately after connecting to a bluetooth reader now works as expected. See [issue 182](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-terminal-android/issues/182) for details.

## 2.5.1 - 2021-11-16

- Fix: Pre-dipping following a cancelled transaction now works as expected. See [issue 179](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-terminal-android/issues/179) for details.

## 2.5.0 - 2021-11-15

- Fix: Pre-dipping now works as expected with Chippers. See [issue 173](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-terminal-android/issues/173) for details.
- Fix: Failure to issue a card-present refund will now invoke error callbacks properly.

## 2.4.1 - 2021-10-25

- Fix: Removed Android 12 bluetooth permissions. See [issue 171](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-terminal-android/issues/171) for details.

## 2.4.0 - 2021-10-21

- New: Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) support was added for internet readers.
- Update: EMV online processing timeout increased from 15s to 30s. Note that this timeout isn't
used by Chipper devices.
- Remove: Remove Machine Driven Registration. It's been moved to the DeviceManagementSDK.
- Fix: Amex cards no longer decline when used via Apple Pay. See [issue 166](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-terminal-android/issues/166) for details.

## 2.3.1 - 2021-09-22

 - Fix: Resolved an issue with class loading in the SDK

## 2.3.0 - 2021-09-21

**Note**: This release has an issue with loading internal classes and should not be used. Update to 2.3.1 instead.

- Fix: Resolved issue that led to some optional reader updates being incorrectly marked as required.

- Fix: Removed `ClassNotFoundException: com.stripe.cots.CotsAdapterProvider` stacktrace on SDK
  initialization. See [issue 155](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-terminal-android/issues/155) for details.

- New: Use `retrieveSetupIntent` to get any SetupIntents that were created outside of your app.

- Update: fields in the `Reader` class have been added/removed. All newly added fields correspond to the same values
  returned by the [Stripe API](https://stripe.com/docs/api/terminal/readers/object)
  - Added `id`, `networkStatus`, `label`, `baseUrl`, `ipAddress`, `livemode`
  - Removed `ipReader`, `cotsDescriptor`

## 2.2.0 - 2021-08-23

- Fix: Resolved intermittent unexpected token invalidation errors when using simlated
readers, and when a connected reader is left idle for a long period of time prior to completing a transaction.

- Fix: Duplicate class conflict with Firebase and other libraries that use `protobuf-javalite` resolved.
See [issue 135](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-terminal-android/issues/135) for details.

- New: [Setup Future Usage](https://stripe.com/docs/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-setup_future_usage)
field added to `PaymentIntentParameters`.

- Fix: When using a simulated BBPOS reader, starting, cancelling, and restarting an update now works as expected.

- Update: Location updates are now only requested when the application consuming the SDK is foregrounded.

- Fix: throw `TerminalException` if `processPayment` gets a success HTTP request (code=200) but with
  `lastPaymentError` being non-null, since it's also a form of decline.

- Update: we will use more precise and consistent `TerminalErrorCode` and error messages for failures of all confirmation operations,
  including processRefund, processPayment, confirmSetupIntent. Specifically,
  For `TerminalErrorCode`:
  - Use `UNSUPPORTED_SDK` if stripe server declined with `terminal_unsupported_sdk_version`.
  - Use `UNSUPPORTED_READER_VERSION` if stripe server declined with `terminal_unsupported_reader_version`.
  - Use `API_SESSION_EXPIRED` if stripe server declined with `api_key_expired`.
  - Use new enum code `STRIPE_API_CONNECTION_ERROR` for general internet connection failures or timeouts.
  - Use `DECLINED_BY_STRIPE_API` for other failures with decode-able responses.
  Comparing to in the past we:
  - Used `STRIPE_API_ERROR` for internet connection failures and all failures with decode-able responses for processRefund.
  - Used `DECLINED_BY_STRIPE_API` for internet connection failures and all failures with decode-able responses for processPayment.
  - Used `DECLINED_BY_STRIPE_API` for internet connection failures and all failures with decode-able responses for confirmSetupIntent.
  What's unchanged:
  - Use `STRIPE_API_RESPONSE_DECODING_ERROR` if SDK fails to decode response from Stripe service.
  For error messages:
  - Use "Could not connect  to Stripe. Please retry." for general connection errors, timeouts.
  - Use the message sent from server.
  Comparing to in the past we:
  - Always used "Stripe API error".

- Update: When discovering readers in our handoff integration mode, `discoverReaders` will only return a
reader if it has been registered. If the current reader has not been registered, `discoverReaders`
will return an empty list of readers.

- Fix: Each of the Terminal SDK AARs now contain keep rules. This allows you to enable Proguard/R8
minification without configuring your own keep rules. See [issue 142](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-terminal-android/issues/142) for details.

- New: Added `generateRegistrationCode` for generating a smart reader registration code without human
intervention. Note that this functionality is only available when the SDK is running directly on a
smart reader device.

- New: Support displaying transaction information on-screen for internet readers using
`Terminal.setReaderDisplay` and `Terminal.clearReaderDisplay`.

- New: `Cart` and `CartLineItem` classes have been added to hold transaction
information used for setting the reader display

## 2.1.0 - 2021-08-02

- New: Added `STRIPE_M2` to `DeviceType`. This reader is in beta testing and
  not yet generally available.

## 2.0.0 - 2021-06-23

### Summary

The Stripe Terminal Android SDK has been updated to support new readers, global
payment processing, and enhanced connectivity and update behavior. To support
this new functionality, weâ€™ve made a number of changes, some of which are
backwards-incompatible with the current Stripe Terminal Mobile SDKs.

If youâ€™re upgrading from a 1.x release, hereâ€™s what you need to know:

- Connecting to a reader has changed.
- We now support using
  [locations](https://stripe.com/docs/api/terminal/locations) with bluetooth
  readers like the Chipper 2X or WisePad 3.
- Use of locations is now required.
- In some cases, Stripe might need to push an update to readers for security or
  compliance reasons; your integration must now support a new optional /
  required update flow.

For upgrading an integration from an older release, see our [SDK migration
guide](https://stripe.com/docs/terminal/sdk-migration-guide)

### Connecting to a reader

`connectReader` has been split into two separate methods: `connectBluetoothReader` and `connectInternetReader`.

#### `connectBluetoothReader`

connectBluetoothReader should be used to connect to any Bluetooth reader like the BBPOS WisePad 3 and BBPOS Chipper 2X BT.

- `connectBluetoothReader` requires providing a new `BluetoothReaderListener`
  which is used to report all reader events.
- The `onReportReaderEvent` and `onReportLowBatteryWarning` methods have been
  moved from the `TerminalListener` to the `BluetoothReaderListener`.
- `ReaderDisplayListener` has been removed and the `onRequestReaderInput` and
  `onRequestReaderDisplayMessage` methods have been moved to the
  `BluetoothReaderListener`.
- `ReaderSoftwareUpdateListener` has been removed, and the
  `BluetoothReaderListener` is used for communicating to your app about updates
  for the reader.

See [Updating reader software: Required
updates](https://stripe.com/docs/terminal/readers/bbpos-chipper2xbt#required-updates)
for more details.

#### `connectInternetReader`

`connectInternetReader` should be used to connect to Internet connected
countertop readers like the Verifone P400 or the BBPOS WisePOS E. There are no
changes required between `connectReader` and `connectInternetReader` for your
countertop reader integration.

## Bluetooth reader updates

The `checkForUpdate` method has been removed. The Stripe Terminal SDK now
checks for required and optional updates during reader connection.

Required update installation is reported to the new `BluetoothReaderListener`
with the `onStartInstallingUpdate` method. Progress will be reported to that
same delegate with `onReportReaderSoftwareUpdateProgress`. When the
installation of the required update finishes the delegate will receive the
`onFinishInstallingUpdate`.

For more information about implementing reader updates, see [Updating reader
software](https://stripe.com/docs/terminal/readers/bbpos-chipper2xbt#updating-reader-software)
and [simulated reader
updates](https://site-admin.stripe.com/docs/terminal/testing#simulated-reader-updates).


## Bluetooth reader locations

Like Internet readers, Bluetooth readers must now be registered to
[Locations](https://stripe.com/docs/api/terminal/locations). Registering your
Bluetooth readers to a location ensures that the readers install the proper
regional configurations and are properly grouped on your account.

To register the reader to a location, create and use a
`BluetoothConnectionConfiguration` object with the locationId set accordingly,
and pass that object in when calling `Terminal.connectBluetoothReader`.

When discovering readers that have already been registered to a location, those
reader objects will have a valid `locationId` property during discovery. If it
makes sense for your application, you can pass that locationId from the
discovered `Reader` object into the `BluetoothConnectionConfiguration`
initializer to keep that reader registered to the same location. This is the
pattern we recommend when discovering and connecting to simulated Bluetooth
readers, which are now automatically registered to a mock location.

When connecting to a reader, you may want to display a list of Locations in
your app. To enable this, the SDK provides the `Terminal.listLocations` method
that takes the same parameters as the [List all
Locations](https://stripe.com/docs/api/terminal/locations/list) API endpoint.
You may want to adjust your connection flow to allow users to pick a location
before they select a reader, should they want to switch that reader's location
manually.

## Detailed changes

- `installUpdate` has been replaced by a no-argument `installAvailableUpdate`
  method, which installs the update stored on the connected reader's
  `availableUpdate`.
- Incremental updates are now treated the same as required updates, resulting in the following
  changes:
  - Removed `UPDATING` from `ConnectionStatus`. All updates are now exclusively communicated via the
    `BluetoothReaderListener`. Required updates that are installed while connecting to a reader will
    be performed while the `ConnectionStatus` is `CONNECTING`.
  - All required reader software updates now report
    `BluetoothReaderListener.onStartInstallingUpdate` and the `Cancelable` provided is now
    nullable. When an incremental-only change is announced, the `Cancelable` will be null since
    these incremental changes are required and cannot be canceled.
  - `ReaderSoftwareUpdate` now has a `components` property that can be used to determine the changes
    that will be applied with this update. `version` can still be used to identify the specific
    firmware, config, and keys that will be installed with the update.
  - On `SimulateReaderUpdate`, replaced `REQUIRED_INCREMENTAL` `REQUIRED_FULL` with `REQUIRED` since
    these update types now behave the same.
- We have changed our packaging for models and callables:
  - Models have been moved from `com.stripe.stripeterminal.model` to
    `com.stripe.stripeterminal.external.models`.
  - Callables have been moved from `com.stripe.stripeterminal.callable` to
    `com.stripe.stripeterminal.external.callable`.
- Replaced `TerminalLifecycleObserver` with `TerminalApplicationDelegate`. Users now must invoke
  `TerminalApplicationDelegate.onCreate` and `TerminalApplicationDelegate.onTrimMemory` from their
  applications.
- Fixed `BluetoothReaderListener.onReportReaderEvent` to properly report card insertion & removal
  events.
- Updated amount types from `Int` to `Long` for the following fields:
  - `PaymentIntent.amount`, `PaymentIntent.amountCapturable`, `PaymentIntent.amountReceived`, &
    `PaymentIntent.applicationFeeAmount`
  - `PaymentIntentParameters.amount` & `PaymentIntentParameters.applicationFeeAmount`
  - `Charge.amount`, `Charge.amountRefunded`, & `Charge.applicationFeeAmount`
  - `RefundParameters.amount`
  - `Refund.amount`
  - `SingleUseMandate.amount`
- Renamed error code `PAYMENT_DECLINED_BY_STRIPE_API` to `DECLINED_BY_STRIPE_API`
- Renamed error code `PAYMENT_DECLINED_BY_READER` to `DECLINED_BY_READER`
- When a reader unexpectedly disconnects during an operation, we swapped the callback order for
  `TerminalListener.onUnexpectedReaderDisconnect` and `Callback.onFailure`. Now,
  `Callback.onFailure` will be called first and `TerminalListener.onUnexpectedReaderDisconnect` will
  be called second. This fixes a bug where we incorrectly failed any new operation started within
  the context of a `TerminalListener.onUnexpectedReaderDisconnect` callback.

## New features

- Invite only: Added support for creating SetupIntents with the WisePad 3.
- Added support for Interac transactions and refunds
- Added support for setting a `SimulatedCard` on the `SimulatorConfiguration`
  object, allowing simulation of different card brands and decline types
- Added support for the P400 in the U.S.

**Made SDK compatible with React Native**
The Stripe Terminal Android SDK uses OkHttp 4.x, while React Native uses 3.x, which was causing a
collision. This release hides our use of OkHttp, so React Native should no longer cause problems.

## 1.0.0-rc1 - 2019-09-09
**Switched to BLE for reader discovery**
This should speed up discovery times slightly, and will prevent some edge cases where the user has
connected to the reader via their device's settings menu, since BLE devices aren't able to connect
from that menu.

**Made the SDK lifecycle aware**
We've made the SDK lifecycle aware so that we can optimize resource use according to what stage of
life the app is in. This change will also give us more debugging info for any future issues.
NOTE: With this change, you'll need to register our lifecycle observer in a few of your
`Application` subclass' methods. See [the installation guide](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-terminal-android#installation)
for more information.

**Added a static `isInitialized` method to `Terminal`**
This can be used to check if there's an existing Terminal object before calling `getInstance`.

**Other changes**
- Made all user-facing objects Parcelable
- Reorganized SDK into packages, so you might need to update your imports
