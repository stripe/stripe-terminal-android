# Release & Support Lifecycle

## Major Release Dates
Major releases will be made approximately once per year. During a major
release, breaking changes to the API may occur, and any deprecated APIs
will be removed. At this time, support for readers that have reached the
end of their support will also be removed from the SDK.

## Minor Release Dates
Minor releases will be made approximately once per month. Minor releases
will not contain breaking changes and will be safe to update without changes
to Terminalâ€™s functionality.

These minor releases may include bug fixes as well as new features to the
SDK. Only the latest major version will receive minor updates containing
new features.

## Maintenance Schedule
Each major release of the SDK will be supported for approximately two years
after its initial release. Only the latest major release will receive minor
release updates according to the minor release schedule.

After a new major release is made, each release will continue to receive
bugfix/patch support only when necessary and until its specified End-of-Life
support date (EOL).

## End of Life (EOL)
When a release reaches its specified bugfix/patch support date, it will
no longer receive support fixes necessary to keep Terminal functional.
While the SDK may continue to work past this date, users should upgrade
their SDK as soon as possible to avoid any interruption in functionality.

## Tap-to-Pay Support

Tap-to-Pay functionality within Terminal may have additional constraints
that require upgrades to your SDK in advance of the timeline described within
this document. Additionally, support for minimum OS versions may be changed
for Tap-to-Pay functionality outside of the SDK. These changes will be
communicated directly to you if they occur.
